The Over the Counter Payment Portal will enable cashiers to record, track, and reconcile payments while also providing hospital management with a clear overview of daily financial activities. The system will facilitate the generation of payment receipts for patients, monitor real-time balances in the cashierâ€™s cash box, and generate detailed transaction reports. Additionally, bank administrators or branch personnel will have access to monitor and oversee hospital cashiers' balances, ensuring greater accountability and financial transparency.
